# Raiiar-Services Chess Application  - Agile Team Development

Available at  

This is a fully functional two-player chess application built as a capstone project for The Firehose Project full-stack development program. Under the guidance of a senior software engineer, we had weekly Agile team meetings for code reviews, sprint planning, and feature assignments. Users are able to create accounts and play games against each other.

The following tools were used to create this application:

Ruby on Rails  
Bootstrap framework  
PostgreSQL database  
Heroku hosting  
RSpec test driven development  
AJAX requests  
jQuery for drag and drop functionality  
Firebase for real-time updates and chat feature
